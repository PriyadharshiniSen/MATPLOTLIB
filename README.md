# MATPLOTLIB
Matplot lib ,magic functions

MATPLOTLIB library contains the functions that could be used to provide a graphical representation to the numerical data using many plots.

The code we type is the frontend and then we have list of backends which do all the processing to print the data in a graphical format.The list of backends that could be given to the %matplotlib are inline,notebook,gtk,qt,qt4,qt5,tk and wx.

There are two types of backends: user interface backends (for use in pygtk, wxpython, tkinter, qt4, or macosx; also referred to as "interactive backends") and hardcopy backends to make image files (PNG, SVG, PDF, PS; also referred to as "non-interactive backends").
